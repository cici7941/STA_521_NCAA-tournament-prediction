We load the data:
```{r}
library(glmnet)
library(stringr)
library(plyr)
#read in teams.csv data and store them as teams
teams = read.csv("teams.csv")
#read in regular seasons data about tournament regions
seasons = read.csv("seasons.csv")
#read in regular seasons data of compact results
compactR = read.csv("regular_season_compact_results.csv")
#read in tournament compact results
compactT = read.csv("tourney_compact_results.csv")
#read in detailed results of the tournament
detailedT = read.csv("tourney_detailed_results.csv")
#read in regular seasons detailed results
detailedR = read.csv("regular_season_detailed_results.csv")
```

Including Seeds:
```{r}
seeds = read.csv("tourney_seeds.csv")

#extract seeds from 2014 tournament
seeds2014 = seeds[which(seeds$season == 2014),]

#subset 2014 tournament details and store it as tourney2014D
tourney2014D = detailedT[which(detailedT$season == 2014),]

tourney2014D = cbind(cbind(tourney2014D, rep(0, dim(tourney2014D)[1])),
                     rep(0, dim(tourney2014D)[1]))
colnames(tourney2014D)[35:36] = c("wSeed", "lSeed")
#reorganize the columns to include "wSeed" and "lSeed"
tourney2014D = tourney2014D[, c(1:2, 35, 3:4, 36, 5:34)]

#extract seeds numbers and store them into tournament data
for(i in 1:dim(tourney2014D)[1]){
  tourney2014D[i, "wSeed"] = as.character(seeds2014[which(seeds2014$team == tourney2014D$wteam[i]),"seed"])
  tourney2014D[i, "lSeed"] = as.character(seeds2014[which(seeds2014$team == tourney2014D$lteam[i]),"seed"])
}
```

Subsetting Tournament into Rounds:
```{r}
#subset first four tournament teams 
firstFour = tourney2014D[1:4,]
#extract first four winners
firstFourWinners = firstFour[,c("wSeed", "wteam")]

#subset first round data
firstRound = tourney2014D[5:36,]
#extract first round winners
firstRoundWinners = firstRound[,c("wSeed", "wteam")]

#subset second round data
secondRound = tourney2014D[37:52,]
#extract second round winners
secondRoundWinners = secondRound[,c("wSeed", "wteam")]

#subset sweet sixteen data
sweetSixteen = tourney2014D[53:60,]
#extract sweet sixteen winning teams
sweetSixteenWinners = sweetSixteen[,c("wSeed", "wteam")]

#subset elite eight data
eliteEight = tourney2014D[61:64,]
#extract elite eight winning teams
eliteEightWinners = eliteEight[,c("wSeed", "wteam")]

#subset final four data
finalFour = tourney2014D[65:67,]
#extract final four teams
finalFourWinners = finalFour[,c("wSeed", "wteam")]
