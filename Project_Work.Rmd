We load the data:
```{r}
teams = read.csv("teams.csv")
seasons = read.csv("seasons.csv")
compactR = read.csv("regular_season_compact_results.csv")
#detailedR
compactT = read.csv("tourney_compact_results.csv")
detailedT = read.csv("tourney_detailed_results.csv")
```

Subset 2014 info:
```{r}
regSeason2014 = compactR[which(compactR$season == 2014),]
tourney2014 = compactT[which(compactT$season == 2014),]
```
